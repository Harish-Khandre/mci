// so when the output of the operation is one or linear such as below its o(n) also known as linear constant

const khandre = ["Harish", "yash", "ishika", "others"];

for (let forest = 0; forest < khandre.length; forest++) {
  if (khandre[forest] === "Harish") {
    console.log("Harish found in the forest bcuz he is not enough for anyone");
    // he will be goat someday and its closer than you think
  }
}

// in the above code the big o is o(n) as it depends on the number of items in array if the array has 100 items the operation gonna run for 100 times thats y o(n)
